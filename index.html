      <h2>What is Qualm?</h2>
      
      <p>Qualm might be referred to simply as a 
	"<acronym title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</acronym>
	event processor" -- it connects to an input MIDI port,
	listens for events, and will output new MIDI events on an
	output port as necessary.  For example, it can listen for
	particular note on/off events and use them to send out patch
	changes, or even duplicate one channel's pedal events on
	other channels so that one pedal can do the work of
	many.</p>
      
      <p>Qualm can also be thought of as a musical analog to the
	software used to control lighting for live shows.  It can
	divide a production into a series of "cues", and step
	through them sequentially based on events.  It can also
	rewind or fast-forward to any given cue state simply by
	entering a cue number into the program.  If the cue numbers
	are linked to measure numbers in the music, it's easy and
	straightforward to use the system for rehearsals.</p>
      
      
      <p>Because Qualm uses MIDI events for all processing, it could
	also be used to control (or be controlled by) any MIDI-enabled
	application, such as lighting boards.</p>

      <h2>What is Qualm written in?</h2>
      
      <p>Qualm is written in Java, and uses the 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/index.jsp">Java
	  Sound API</a> for all processing.  In order to use it,
	therefore, you will need an implementation of Java Sound
	that can talk to your MIDI devices.  For Windows, this will
	require a JDK version 1.4.1 or greater.  For Linux, I
	recommend the use of the open-source 
	<a href="http://www.tritonus.org/">Tritonus</a> implementation.
	This implementation also has support for 
	<a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> devices.</p>

      
      <p>For more information on Java Sound, see the 
	<a href="http://www.jsresources.org/">Java Sound Resources</a>
	page.</p>

	<p>Qualm also makes use of the <a
	    href="http://www.gnu.org/software/java/packages.html">gnu.getopt</a>
	  command-line option parser.</p>

      <h2>The History of Qualm</h2>
      
      <p>Qualm was created for a simple purpose -- to handle patch
	changes during live MIDI performances.  One such example is
	musical theater, where the keyboard or synthesizer part is
	often written to use many different patches during a
	performance, occasionally with very fast changes in between
	them.</p>
      
      <p>In fact, Qualm was created to handle one <a
	  href="http://www.mit.edu/~mtg">musical theater
	  organization</a>'s production of <a
	  href="http://www.batboy-themusical.com">Bat Boy: The
	  Musical</a>, a show in which the keyboard parts are used to
	simulate a much larger orchestra, and thus requires many
	patch changes to create a multitude of horns, strings,
	organs, etc.  The Keyboard II part for that production had
	over 130 patch changes during a single two-hour performance,
	and was handling changes for two different keyboards and a
	drum module.</p>
      
      <p>With such a huge undertaking, it was either going to be
	necessary to purchase or borrow a large array of pedals, or
	find some sort of programmatic control that could simulate
	having that much equipment and feed it all to a single
	synthesizer (in that case, a very capable Roland JV-1080).
	We chose the latter route, and were able to control both
	keyboards and the drum module using a Linux laptop and
	existing equipment.</p>
      
      <p>Since then, the software has been used for patch changes for
        a number of different shows.  Interesting configurations
        include a three-keyboard setup in which all the keyboards were
        independently controlled by a single Qualm routine, but also
        using the ability to have one keyboard's change also switch
        patches for another keyboard. Qualm can also be used to
        listen to the notes as they are played and automatically
        switch patches without additional intervention.</p>
